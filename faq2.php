                              The InstantSave option is a savings feature on SumoBank that enables you to add more funds to your savings anytime you want. For example, if you set N2,000 daily and you miss a day or two, you can use the Instant save option to deposit N2,000 or N4,000 at once. This is to ensure you meet up with your savings target that you missed.                            </div>
